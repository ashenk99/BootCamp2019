Hi,

I just wanted to let you know that I am unfortunately unable to complete the problem sets for this week. I have been very busy with recruiting work for an internship next summer, and didn't feel the amount of time I had to work on the problems was sufficient to create a submission I would be proud of turning in. I apologize for the inconvenience. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the bootcamp, the amazing people I met and the excellent instructors I had the chance to learn from.

Best,

Alan Shenkerman
